# Alphabet Soup Deep Learning Project

## Overview

This project involves building a binary classification model using deep learning techniques to predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. The model is designed to assist the nonprofit foundation in selecting applicants with the best chance of success in their ventures.

## Files and Directory Structure

- `deep-learning-challenge/`
  - `data/`: (optional) Directory to store the dataset (charity_data.csv).
  - `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
    - `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb`: Notebook for preprocessing, model compilation, training, and evaluation.
    - `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb`: Notebook for model optimization.
  - `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`: Saved model file.
  - `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`: Optimized model file.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Instructions

1. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Open `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb` in Google Colab.
   - Follow the preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for the neural network.

2. **Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model:**
   - Continue with the same notebook.
   - Design, compile, and train the neural network model.
   - Evaluate the model using the test data.

3. **Optimize the Model:**
   - Open `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb` in a new Colab file.
   - Repeat preprocessing steps and implement at least three optimization methods.
   - Save and export the optimized model.

4. **Write a Report on the Neural Network Model:**
   - Provide a detailed analysis in `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb`.
   - Include information on data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

5. **Copy Files Into Your Repository:**
   - Download the notebooks from Google Colab.
   - Move them into the `deep-learning-challenge/notebooks/` directory.
   - Push the changes to your GitHub repository.
